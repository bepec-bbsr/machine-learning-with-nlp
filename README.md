## What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning course been one of the highly opted course across different industries and different levels of experience. Machine learning Definition: Machine learning is the branch of Artificial intelligence which helps the computers to make decisions without human help and with less amount of programming

**Machine learning Applications:** Machine learning implemented across different industries like finance, healthcare, manufacturing, IT, Tech, Banking e.t.c. Some of the examples like self driving cars, face unlock, text suggestions, text to speech, speech to text, facebook tagging a friend, Iphone Siri e.t.c. are some of the examples of Machine learning

**How to start?** Anyone who is interested on Machine learning can start by reading some machine learning pdf or reading some machine learning introduction or one can download some [free machine learning books or read various machine learning blogs](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/05/10-more-free-must-read-books-for-machine-learning-and-data-science.html). If above ways seem difficult to learn you can opt for Machine learning course. Once check machine learning job descriptions for more skillset on machine learning.
