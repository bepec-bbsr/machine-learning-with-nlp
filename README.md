## What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning course been one of the highly opted course across different industries and different levels of experience. Machine learning Definition: Machine learning is the branch of Artificial intelligence which helps the computers to make decisions without human help and with less amount of programming

**Machine learning Applications:** Machine learning implemented across different industries like finance, healthcare, manufacturing, IT, Tech, Banking e.t.c. Some of the examples like self driving cars, face unlock, text suggestions, text to speech, speech to text, facebook tagging a friend, Iphone Siri e.t.c. are some of the examples of Machine learning

**How to start?** Anyone who is interested on Machine learning can start by reading some machine learning pdf or reading some machine learning introduction or one can download some [free machine learning books or read various machine learning blogs](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/05/10-more-free-must-read-books-for-machine-learning-and-data-science.html). If above ways seem difficult to learn you can opt for Machine learning course. Once check machine learning job descriptions for more skillset on machine learning.
* Our course data science with machine learning and NLP with python is crafted in such a way that even a layman can crack job on data science.
* Our course contains Statistics, linear algebra, Probability, Python Programming, Machine learning and Data Visualization.
* Each and every concept is carried with real time example as well as with an assignment to work.
* A data scientist is very known for building prediction models using machine learning techniques like forecasting, regression and classification.
* Here in our training you gonna learn nearly 13+ machine learning algorithms like decision trees, ensembling methods, non-parametric methods e.t.c.
* Each and every algorithm was ended up with one real - time project and it's applications and creating documentation for each project.
* Nearly 15+ live real - time projects you people going to work in our trainings.
* After the training we prepare your resume and market it across different industries and test you with various mock interviews and projects until you crack job on Data Science.

## Let's get started :grin:

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

* Python
* Anaconda
* Core packages

### Installing
Python is available for all three major operating systems — Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux — and the installer, as well as the documentation, can be downloaded from the official [Python website:](https://www.python.org). And don't forget to check the box where it's prompted for add to *enviroment variable path.

This repo is written for Python version >= 3.4.3, and it is recommended you use the most recent version of Python 3 that is currently available, although most of the code examples may also be compatible with Python >= 2.7.10. If you decide to use Python 2.7 to execute the code examples, please make sure that you know about the major differences between the two Python versions. A good summary about the differences between Python 3.4 and 2.7 can be found at [py2 vs py3](https://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3).

##### Note :blue_book:

You can check your current default version of Python by executing
```
$ python -V
```
In my case it returns
```
Python 3.6.5 |Anaconda, Inc.
```
#### Pip

The additional packages that we will be using throughout this book can be installed via the pip installer program, which has been part of the Python standard library since Python 3.3. More information about pip can be found at https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html.

After we have successfully installed Python, we can execute pip from the command line terminal to install additional Python packages:
```
$ pip install PythonPackages
```
where ```PythonPackages``` is a placeholder for *numpy*, *pandas*, *matplotlib*, *scikit-learn*, and *so forth*.

Already installed packages can be updated via the ``--upgrade`` flag:
```
$ pip install PythonPackages --upgrade
```
#### Anaconda

A highly recommended alternative Python distribution for scientific computing is Anaconda by Continuum Analytics. Anaconda is a free—including commercial use—enterprise-ready Python distribution that bundles all the essential Python packages for data science, math, and engineering in one user-friendly cross-platform distribution. The Anaconda installer can be downloaded at http://continuum.io/downloads#py34, and an Anaconda quick start-guide is available at https://store.continuum.io/static/img/Anaconda-Quickstart.pdf.

After successfully installing Anaconda, we can install new Python packages using the following command:
```
conda install PythonPackages
```
Existing packages can be updated using the following command:
```
conda update PythonPackages
```
We will mainly use NumPy's multi-dimensional arrays to store and manipulate data. Occasionally, we will make use of pandas, which is a library built on top of NumPy that provides additional higher level data manipulation tools that make working with tabular data even more convenient. To augment our learning experience and visualize quantitative data, which is often extremely useful to intuitively make sense of it, we will use the very customizable matplotlib library.

#### Core packages

The version numbers of the major Python packages that were used for writing this repo are listed below. Please make sure that the version numbers of your installed packages are equal to, or greater than, those version numbers to ensure the code examples run correctly:
* [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)
* [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)

### Python/Jupyter Notebook

Some readers weere wondering about the `.ipynb` of the code files -- these files are IPython notebooks. I chose IPython notebooks over plain Python `.py` scripts, because we think that they are just great for data analysis projects! IPython notebooks allow us to have everything in one place: Our code, the results from executing the code, plots of our data, and documentation that supports the handy Markdown and powerful LaTeX syntax!

##### Side Note:

"IPython Notebook" recently became the "Jupyter Notebook"; Jupyter is an umbrella project that aims to support other languages in addition to Python including Julia, R, and many more. Don't worry, though, for a Python user, there's only a difference in terminology (we say "Jupyter Notebook" now instead of "IPython Notebook").

The Jupyter notebook can be installed as usually via pip.

```
$ pip install jupyter notebook
```
Alternatively, we can use the Conda installer if we have Anaconda or Miniconda installed:

```
$ conda install jupyter notebook
```
To open a Jupyter notebook, we cd to the directory that contains your code examples

```
$ cd ~/code/python-machine-learning-book
```
and launch ``jupyter notebook`` by executing

```
$ jupyter notebook
```
Jupyter will start in our default browser (typically running at http://localhost:8888/). Now, we can simply select the notebook you wish to open from the Jupyter menu.

### Alternative 

```Colaboratory``` is a hosted Jupyter notebook environment that is free to use and requires no setup.
